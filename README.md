# Air-Manager-Add-Ons
Misc Instruments and Panels I've created for Air Manager/X-Plane

Panel Backgrounds contains images that can be used as backgrounds with my instrument overlays. They have the "holes" in them to deal with popout instruments like the RealityXP GTNs or the AFM G5's such that you can use them on a touch screen.

GTN750 and GTN650 are panel overlays for the RealityXP GTN650 and GTN750, working in the same fashion as the GNS430/GNS5320 overlays that are supplied with Air Manager. They can be imported into Air Manager via the supplied .siff files. I've also included the individual files that end up in a subdirectory in instruments\OPEN_DIRECTORY\ of Air Manager's installation directory, but you shouldn't need these if you import with the siff.

Several of these instruments have been submitted to Air Manager and may be available in their selection of Online instruments.

In general, the process is as follows:
* Install the instruments you want to use, such as the RealityXP GTN650.
* Clone an existing panel such as the C172 one.
* Change it to use one of my backgrounds, or modify one of my backgrounds if you don't like where I made the "holes" and set it to use that. This is done at the bottom of the panel window in the "Panels" tab of Air Manager.
* Import the .siff file for the instrument you'd like to add. This can be done in the "Create/Edit" tab of "Air Manager".
* Add the instrument to your panel, dragging it so that the touch area of the instrument lines up with one of the transparent "holes" in the background image.
* Optional: If you've got a Knobster make sure it's assigned correctly.
* Launch X-Plane 11, start a flight in an airplane that has the instrument installed, and make the instrument "pop out". Drag the instrument so that it is behind the Air Manager panel, positioned with its touch area over the transparent section of the background. Resize as necessary.
